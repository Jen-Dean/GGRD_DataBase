## General info
We are creating a database where anyone can import the WFTDA .xlsx files and have it imported into our database, where we can then etrapolate stats, line up strengths, and other information.

We will create 2 different products.

1. A Database repository
  * with ability to pull stats from any game uploaded
  * be able to pull performance and match up stats from individual players
  * be able to pull historical performance from teams
2. An app that can be used during LIVE games
  * To be able to track match up performances as the game is happening
  * should not require WIFI or internet
